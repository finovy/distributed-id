#  Project Overview

The project utilizes Redis, Segment, and Snowflake as its primary distributed ID generation solutions, aiming to minimize external dependencies and standardize internal processes for generating distributed IDs within the team. The project offers three access methods: Http, Rpc, and Grpc, to cater to the diverse language requirements of internal projects as much as possible.
